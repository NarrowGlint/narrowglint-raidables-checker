# narrowglint-raidables-checker
SWEP to check for raidables (printers/meth/etc.) through bases and walls in Garry's Mod DarkRP.


**Download**  
Just download this and put the lua, readme, liscence files in the addons directory. So a dir would be addons/narrowglints-raidable-checker/lua/....

**Configuration**  
Head over to lua/autorun/config.lua. Make sure to add your entities classname in the same format! Don't forget commas!  
If you want to increase, or decrease the range you going to have to go to lua/weapons/weapon_raidablechecker.lua and edit the Vector:Add. This will be frontPos and backPos :add. Change the range by playing with the numbers you can figure it out. I tried to add it to the config file but unfortunately gmod doesn't like when I do that with vectors.

**Usage**  
Go in game, q menu, weapons, narrowglint, then click on the Raidable Checker. Left click to check for raidables!
