# narrowglint-raidables-checker
SWEP to check for raidables (printers/meth/etc.) through bases and walls in Garry's Mod DarkRP.


UPDATES COMING SOON!

If you want to add/change the raidables you will have to go into the weapons file and add another if statement. I understand this isn't the most efficient way to do things and I've tried others. GLua does have its limits that make it harder to adjust to.
